# YDKJS: Up & Going - Chapter 1 Practice
This is my solution to the exercise at the end of the chapter 1 in the book [*"You Don't Know JS: Up & Going"*](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/1st-ed/up%20%26%20going/README.md) by Kyle Simpson.

The task was as follows:
* Write a program to calculate the total price of phone purchase. User would keep purchasing phones until running out of money in his bank account. User would also buy accessories for each phone as long as the purchase amount was below his mental spending threshold.
* After user's purchase amount has been calculated, the tax was added, then the calculated purchase amount was printed out, properly formatted.
* Finally, the amount against user's bank account balance was checked to see if he can afford it or not.
* Set up some constants for the "tax rate," "phone price," "accessory price," and "mental spending threshold," as well as a variable for user's "bank account balance".
* Define functions for calculating the tax and for formatting the price with a "$" and rounding to two decimal places.
* Try to incorporate input into this program.
